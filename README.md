2. Arunsundar[Project Executive]
3. Jegan[Technical Enthusiasist]
4. Ritik Magotra[Project flow organizer]

### Steps to be Followed:
1. Run main server, server1, server2, server3, server4.
2. Run dataProtection.ipynb in Jupyter notebook.
3. Enter input credential [[in password box]]("#") in dataProtection.ipynb in Jupyter notebook.
4. Then the actual data is converted into an encoded key value by encryption technique is then directly split up and passed into 4 servers.
5. The data will combine at the main Database server.
6. Finally, The Data will be secured at any instance of databreach in the network layer.

### Encryption Technique
In encryption, the sent data is modified into unreadable format between the users.  
A key is required to encrypt the data called the encryption key. Only the parties that have this key are able to get access to the data.

### Decryption Technique
In Decryption, the received data is modified into readable format to a user. 
When the data reaches the receiver, the data is again modified to its original form. This process called Decryption. 
Only the parties that have this key are able to get access to the data.
